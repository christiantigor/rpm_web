                            <p>Field productivity improved when it is maintained according to plant ideal condition.</p>
                            <p><strong>Micro climate monitoring</strong>. Ambient temperature and humidity, soil pH and humidity, solar exposure, rainfall and wind. Adjust plant &amp; field treatment, based on these parameters on specified point in field, will result in richer crops.</p>
                            <p><strong>Plant condition</strong>. Monitoring plants across field is error prone and tedious for large scale field. Beside manual inspection, RPM use distributed wireless camera so that condition and images of plant can be obtained and archived for analysis purpose.</p>

                            <p>Money, time, and energy is saved whenever you can cut amount of water, fertilizer, and pesticide. Most importantly, you preseve your field fertility from excessive chemical.</p>
                            <p><strong>Put optimum amount of resources</strong>. Research shows that excessive water, fertilizer, and pesticide bring bad effect to soil fertility and plant health. Not to mention pests become more resistant.</p>
                            <p>RPM continuously measure level of humidity, wind, pH, various gas substance, so that you can apply correct amount of resources at the correct time. Save money and save environment, concurrently.</p>        
                            <p><strong>Easy installation</strong>. Using wireless Seamless Mesh technology, RPM allows you to install the system quickly since no wiring work needed. 2-3 weeks is all that is needed.</p>

                            <p>Plant illness or pests, both are farmer nightmare. Locate touch point quickly or even predict possibility of such attack will help minimize damage - faster action means fewer loss.</p>
                            <p><strong>Distributed imagery</strong>. RPMTM use Mesh VisionTM technology to capture images across several point in field. This is a distributed wireless camera, so that you can see plant and field: see when plant color turn bad, pests playing around your plant.</p>
                            <p><strong>Threshold monitoring</strong>. Whenever level of humidity drop, soil nutrient insufficient, soil too dry, smoke/fire detected, operators will get notification via app, email, and SMS.</p>
